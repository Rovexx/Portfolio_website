# **Portfolio website Roel Versteeg**

This repository contains all code related to my portfolio website.
The website can be found at [www.rovex.nl](http://www.rovex.nl).
I have some basic knowlage of how to make websites, and how to write several back-end services for website interaction.
But I am `NOT` a webdeveloper and dont want to be. So forgive some *'bad practices'* here and there.
